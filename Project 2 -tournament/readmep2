To run the program on linux, first run '\i tournament.sql' from the psql command prompt, from the directory 'tournament.sql' is located, and then run 'python tournament_test.py'. 

The arguments of reportMatch in tournament_test.py have been modified to accomodate to the extra credit task. "Support games where a draw (tied game) is possible. This will require changing the arguments to reportMatch." Also, I accidently deleted code in testPairings that checks to see if the pairs are correct. My application did pass 'testPairings' before I deleted that code though.

My project has been made to pass two of the extra credit tasks:

1. Don’t assume an even number of players. If there is an odd number of players, assign one player a “bye” (skipped round). A bye counts as a free win. A player should not receive more than one bye in a tournament.

2.Support games where a draw (tied game) is possible. This will require changing the arguments to reportMatch.
